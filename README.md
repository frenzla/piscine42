# My Piscine @42

These are all the exercises I validated during my piscine at 42 (March 2024).
I have included all subjects of the piscine (even the one not completed).

> Disclaimer: the code in this repo has been checked and approved by 2 peers (each module) and by the moulinette (automated verification system of 42) but is probably not fault proof!

# 42 & the Piscine

42 is a global higher education initiative that proposes a new way of learning computer science:
- No teachers
- No classrooms
- Open 24/7, 365 days/year
- Students are trained through peer-to-peer pedagogy, and project-based learning.
- Methodology that develops both tech & life skills.
- The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process.

The so-called "Piscine", a 28-day C programming bootcamp. It is the last stage of the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

# Skills developed at the Piscine

### Hard-skills
	  C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	  Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	  Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	  Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	  Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	  Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
